Cab Driver Billing System
Problem Statement:
You are part of a cab aggregator company, Allen Cabs,  which allows you to book a cab like ola/uber.
As a part of the Driver Billing team, you need to create a system which generates bills for drivers periodically based on the kms they have driven.

Platform Capabilities:
Drivers get onboarded to Allen Cabs and assigned a unique Id. 
Based on model of car, cars are divided into 3 categories 
Economy
Premium
Luxury
Billing is calculated based on the distance driven by drivers during the booking/trip period.
Trips can be of type - intra-city or outstation
For billing, Price/km is based on different car categories. 
Intra-city charges are as follows :
Economy - Rs 5/km
Premium - Rs 12/km
Luxury - Rs 15/km
Charges for outstation are 2x of the intra-city.
If a trip is canceled by a driver, the driver is fined a fixed amount of Rs 10, else if it’s canceled by a customer, the driver is compensated by a fixed amount of Rs.10.
Bill the driver on the basis of Kms driven and its car category, along with the cancellation cases.

Bonus Capabilities:
If your program can charge a variable cancellation fee based on the trip type and car category.
Get Bill of driver for a time interval
Drivers can use their own vehicle or may lease it from the Allen Cabs.
Allen Cabs charges a commission (x %),  if the vehicle is leased to the driver.

GetBill
GetBill(“Ramesh”) 
(50 * 5 ) + (1050 * 5*2) + 10 = Rs 10760

GetBill(“Manjunath”) 
(-10) +  (70 * 12 * 2) = Rs 1670
